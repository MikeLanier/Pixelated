# Pixelated
There was an old game I had on one of  my first cell phones, way back when call Pixelated.  You change the color of the top left cell, and every neighboring cell colored the same as the previous color of the top left cell would change to the new color.  Continue doing this until all cell are the same color. The goal of the game is to get all cells the same color in as few moves as possible.  This is old C++ code which I wrote back around 2000.
